**Disclaimer: AI-Assisted Parametric Development and Contributions**

This repository and its associated projects have been developed with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) models. Depending on the project, this may include one or more models such as GPT-like models, BART-like models, and other specialized transformer models. As a Parametric Developer, I have utilized these AI models to assist in writing, debugging, and documenting the code in this repository.

1. **AI Assistance**: AI models, while powerful and versatile, operate based on patterns and associations present in the data used for training. They have been instrumental in expediting the development process and providing insights. However, their outputs have been carefully reviewed and validated to ensure correctness, security, and efficiency.

2. **Accountability**: I have overseen the entire development process, including operating the IDE, managing the GitHub repositories, engineering prompts, designing the schema and architecture, and documenting the process. While AI plays a significant role, I take full responsibility for the outcomes of AI-assisted code generation and development, and I recognize the importance of maintaining the quality and integrity of the final codebase.

3. **Limitations**: AI models have inherent limitations. They lack the true understanding, context, and domain-specific knowledge that human developers possess. Therefore, any code or results produced by AI have been subject to rigorous testing, debugging, and validation before being included in the project.

4. **Collaborative Development**: I value collaboration, feedback, and constructive criticism from the developer community. While AI can streamline certain aspects of development, human expertise remains essential for complex problem-solving, architectural decisions, and ensuring the overall success of the project.

5. **Contributions**: Contributions from the developer community are welcome and appreciated. If you wish to contribute, please create a fork of the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. All contributions will be reviewed before being merged to ensure they align with the project's goals and standards.

6. **Acknowledgement**: The code in this repository is the result of a collaborative effort between AI models and potentially multiple human contributors. I appreciate the collaborative nature of open-source development and acknowledge the potential diversity of inputs in this project.

7. **Licensing**: This repository and associated projects are shared under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE), which governs the usage, modification, and distribution of the code. Users and contributors are required to comply with the terms and conditions specified in the license.

In summary, this project employs AI models to enhance software development and documentation automation efforts. While AI plays a significant role, it is not a substitute for human expertise, and I am committed to maintaining the highest standards of code quality, security, and reliability through collaborative development and continuous improvement.
